# [CSES](https://cses.fi/) is a website that has problems and resources for coding

## The Algorithms course in that site has 100 problems and I am trying to learn algorithms by following that couse and solving the problems.

## I will List down problems in this README as I solve tham and also have this as a notes to refer in the future


## Problem 1 - Weird Algorithm [question link](https://cses.fi/alon/task/1068)
## Solution - Approach [code](https://github.com/kirankumar2079/competivtive-programming/blob/master/cses/algorithms/weird_algorithm.cpp)
#### It is a straightforward problem where you just need to iterate till n = 1 and do the opeartion as insructed and print the value


## Problem 2 - Increasing Array [question link](https://cses.fi/alon/task/1094/)
## Solution  - Approach [code](https://github.com/kirankumar2079/competivtive-programming/blob/master/cses/algorithms/increasing_array.cpp)
#### It is a very straight forward question just by calculation of the differnce of adjacent elemets we can get the answer , try to do without modifying the input if possible do not store the input . This is a kind of problem which we can solve without storing the input which will save a lot of space and time in real world 

## Problem 3 - Two Sets [question link](https://cses.fi/alon/task/1092) solved on 25 april 2024
## Solution - Approach [code](https://github.com/kirankumar2079/competivtive-programming/blob/master/cses/algorithms/two_sets.cpp)
#### The first part is simple and we can solve by seeing if we can split the sum of the first n numbers or not (Is it even or odd basically) , In the second part use a technique to split the array into two numbers there are multiple approaches but I have used a simple approach by keeping the larger numbers first into one vector and remaing in the second vector.
