# [CSES](https://cses.fi/) is a website that has problems and resources for coding

## The Algorithms course in that site has 100 problems and I am trying to learn algorithms by following that couse and solving the problems.

## I will List down problems in this README as I solve tham and also have this as a notes to refer in the future


## Problem 1 - Weird Algorithm [link](https://cses.fi/alon/task/1068)
## Solution - Approach [code](https://github.com/kirankumar2079/competivtive-programming/blob/master/cses/algorithms/weird_algorithm.cpp)
#### It is a straightforward problem where you just need to iterate till n = 1 and do the opeartion as insructed and print the value


## Problem 2 - Increasing Array [link](https://cses.fi/alon/task/1094/)
## Solution  - Approach [code](https://github.com/kirankumar2079/competivtive-programming/blob/master/cses/algorithms/increasing_array.cpp)
#### It is a very straight forward question just by calculation of the differnce of adjacent elemets we can get the answer , try to do without modifying the input if possible do not store the input . This is a kind of problem which we can solve without storing the input which will save a lot of space and time in real world
